class Eof(object):

    def __init__(self, dataset, weights=None, center=True, ddof=1):
        """Create an Eof object.

        The EOF solution is computed at initialization time. Method
        calls are used to retrieve computed quantities.

        **Arguments:**

        *dataset*
            A `numpy.ndarray`, `numpy.ma.MaskedArray` or `dask.array.Array`
            with two or more dimensions containing the data to be analysed.
            The first dimension is assumed to represent time. Missing
            values are permitted, either in the form of a masked array, or
            `numpy.nan` values. Missing values must be constant with time
            (e.g., values of an oceanographic field over land).

        **Optional arguments:**

        *weights*
            An array of weights whose shape is compatible with those of
            the input array *dataset*. The weights can have the same
            shape as *dataset* or a shape compatible with an array
            broadcast (i.e., the shape of the weights can can match the
            rightmost parts of the shape of the input array *dataset*).
            If the input array *dataset* does not require weighting then
            the value *None* may be used. Defaults to *None* (no
            weighting).

        *center*
            If *True*, the mean along the first axis of *dataset* (the
            time-mean) will be removed prior to analysis. If *False*,
            the mean along the first axis will not be removed. Defaults
            to *True* (mean is removed).

            The covariance interpretation relies on the input data being
            anomaly data with a time-mean of 0. Therefore this option
            should usually be set to *True*. Setting this option to
            *True* has the useful side effect of propagating missing
            values along the time dimension, ensuring that a solution
            can be found even if missing values occur in different
            locations at different times.

        *ddof*
            'Delta degrees of freedom'. The divisor used to normalize
            the covariance matrix is *N - ddof* where *N* is the
            number of samples. Defaults to *1*.

        **Returns:**

        *solver*
            An `Eof` instance.

        **Examples:**

        EOF analysis of a data array with spatial dimensions that
        represent latitude and longitude with weighting. In this example
        the data array is dimensioned (ntime, nlat, nlon), and in order
        for the latitude weights to be broadcastable to this shape, an
        extra length-1 dimension is added to the end::

            from eofs.standard import Eof
            import numpy as np

        *weighted*

            used for the EOF analysis prior to projection. If *False*
            then no weighting is applied. Defaults to *True* (weighting
