    """EOF analysis (meta-data enabled `cdms2` interface)"""

    def __init__(self, dataset, weights=None, center=True, ddof=1):
        """Create an Eof object.

        The EOF solution is computed at initialization time. Method
        calls are used to retrieve computed quantities.

        **Argument:**

        *dataset*
            A `cdms2` variable containing the data to be analysed. Time
            must be the first dimension. Missing values are allowed
            provided that they are constant with time (e.g., values of
            an oceanographic field over land).

        **Optional arguments:**

        *weights*
            Sets the weighting method. The following pre-defined
            weighting methods are available:

            * *'area'* : Square-root of grid cell area normalized by
              total grid area. Requires a latitude-longitude grid to be
              present in the `cdms2` variable *dataset*. This is a
              fairly standard weighting strategy. If you are unsure
              which method to use and you have gridded data then this
              should be your first choice.

            * *'coslat'* : Square-root of cosine of latitude. Requires a
              latitude dimension to be present in the `cdms2` variable
              *dataset*.

            * *None* : Equal weights for all grid points (*'none'* is
              also accepted).

             Alternatively an array of weights whose shape is compatible
             with the `cdms2` variable *dataset* may be supplied instead
             of specifying a weighting method.

        *center*
            If *True*, the mean along the first axis of *dataset* (the
            time-mean) will be removed prior to analysis. If *False*,
            the mean along the first axis will not be removed. Defaults
            to *True* (mean is removed).

            The covariance interpretation relies on the input data being
            anomalies with a time-mean of 0. Therefore this option
            should usually be set to *True*. Setting this option to
            *True* has the useful side effect of propagating missing
            values along the time dimension, ensuring that a solution
            can be found even if missing values occur in different
            locations at different times.

        *ddof*
            'Delta degrees of freedom'. The divisor used to normalize
            the covariance matrix is *N - ddof* where *N* is the
            number of samples. Defaults to *1*.

        **Returns:**

        *solver*
            An `Eof` instance.

        Given a data set, projects it onto the EOFs to generate a
        corresponding set of pseudo-PCs.

        **Argument:**

        *field*
            A `cdms2` variable containing the field to project onto the
            EOFs. It must have the same corresponding spatial dimensions
            (including missing values in the same places) as the `Eof`
            input *dataset*. It may have a different length time
            dimension to the `Eof` input *dataset* or no time dimension
            at all. If a time dimension exists it must be the first
            dimension.

        **Optional arguments:**

        *neofs*
            Number of EOFs to project onto. Defaults to all EOFs. If the
            number of EOFs requested is more than the number that are
            available, then the field will be projected onto all
            available EOFs.

        *eofscaling*
            Set the scaling of the EOFs that are projected
            onto. The following values are accepted:

            * *0* : Un-scaled EOFs (default).
            * *1* : EOFs are divided by the square-root of their eigenvalue.
            * *2* : EOFs are multiplied by the square-root of their
              eigenvalue.

        *weighted*
            If *True* then the field is weighted using the same weights
            used for the EOF analysis prior to projection. If *False*
            then no weighting is applied. Defaults to *True* (weighting
            is applied). Generally only the default setting should be
            used.

        **Returns:**

        *pseudo_pcs*
            A `cdms2` variable containing the pseudo-PCs. The PCs are
            numbered from 0 to *neofs* - 1.

        **Examples:**

        Project a field onto all EOFs::

            pseudo_pcs = solver.projectField(field)
