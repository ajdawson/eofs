Package description
===================

`eofs` is a Python package for EOF analysis of spatial-temporal data.
Using EOFs (empirical orthogonal functions) is a common technique to decompose a signal varying in time and space into a form that is easier to interpret in terms of spatial and temporal variance.
Some of the key features of `eofs` are:

* **Suitable for large data sets:** computationally efficient for the large output data sets of modern climate models.
* **Transparent handling of missing values:** missing values are removed automatically during computations and placed back into output fields.
* **Automatic metadata:** metadata from input fields is used to construct metadata for output fields.
* **No Compiler required:** a fast implementation written in pure Python using the power of numpy_, no Fortran or C dependencies.


Download and installation
-------------------------

The core of the package runs on Python 2 or 3, on Linux, Windows or OSX; basically anywhere Python+NumPy are available.
The :ref:`cdms <cdms-interface>`, :ref:`iris <iris-interface>`, and :ref:`xarray <xarray-interface>` interfaces are available on all platforms where their respective supporting packages UV-CDAT_, iris_, and xarray_ can be installed.

`eofs` can be installed for all platforms using conda_::

    conda install -c conda-forge eofs

or using pip::

    pip install eofs

The source code for released versions of `eofs` can be downloaded from `Github <https://github.com/ajdawson/eofs/releases>`_.
You must have setuptools_ installed in order to install `eofs` from source.
After downloading the source code archive, unzip it and change into the unzipped archive's directory, then to install it::

    python setup.py install

You can also check out the source code for the development version from the `github repository <https://github.com/ajdawson/eofs>`_ to access features which are not yet in a release.


Getting started
---------------

`eofs` provides various interfaces for EOF analysis: a *standard* interface for analysing data contained in either `numpy` arrays or `dask` arrays, suitable for any data set; and meta-data interfaces suitable for analysing data read from self-describing files, using the `cdms2`, `iris`, or `xarray` packages.
All the interfaces support the same set of operations.

Regardless of which interface you use, the basic usage is the same.
The EOF analysis is handled by a solver class, and the EOF solution is computed when the solver class is created.
Method calls are then used to retrieve the quantities of interest from the solver class.

The following is a very simple illustrative example which computes the leading 2 EOFs of a temporal spatial field using the `eofs.iris` interface:

.. code-block:: python

   import iris
   from eofs.iris import Eof

   # read a spatial-temporal field, time must be the first dimension
   sst = iris.load_cube('sst_monthly.nc')

   # create a solver class, taking advantage of built-in weighting
   solver = Eof(sst, weights='coslat')

   # retrieve the first two EOFs from the solver class
   eofs = solver.eofs(neofs=2)

More detailed description of usage are found in the :doc:`userguide/index` or the :doc:`examples/index`.


Requirements
------------

This package requires as a minimum that you have numpy_ available, and requires setuptools_ for installation.
The dask_ package is an optional dependency that will be used if `dask.array` is available and `dask` arrays are provided to the solver.
The `eofs.cdms` meta-data enabled interface can only be used if the `cdms2` module is available.
This module is distributed as part of the UV-CDAT_ project.
The `eofs.iris` meta-data enabled interface can only be used if the iris_ package is available at version 1.2 or higher.
The `eofs.xarray` meta-data enabled interface can only be used if the xarray_ package is installed.


Citation
--------

If you use eofs in published research, please cite it by referencing the `peer-reviewed paper <http://doi.org/10.5334/jors.122>`_.
You can additionally cite the `Zenodo DOI <http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.46871>`_ if you need to cite a particular version (but please also cite the paper, it helps me justify my time working on this and similar projects).


Developing and contributing
---------------------------

Contributions big or small are welcomed from anyone with an interest in the project.
Bug reports and feature requests can be filed using the Github issues_ system.
